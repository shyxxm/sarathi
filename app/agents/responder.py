"""Node 3. What to say to the driver. SPEC 3.4.

Two halves, and the first one is not a model call. `assemble()` builds what the
responder is allowed to see — resolved stop, resolved customer, the clock as
`domain/` computed it, and only the retrieved chunks that cleared the relevance
floor. `respond()` sends that and validates what comes back.

The model gets no ids it could echo into a citation except the chunk ids in
front of it, and `ResponderOutput` has no `mode` field, so it cannot route
itself. Identity is already resolved before anything here runs (rule 3), and
nothing here writes state (rule 4).
